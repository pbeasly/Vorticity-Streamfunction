# Streamfunction-Vorticity
Project contains simulations of the time evolution of the vorticity and stream function equations. An animation is created that shows the vorticity evolution with time of a Gaussian 'bump'
File descriptions:
- Vorticity-Animation.gif:  Animation of the vorticity time evolution.
- Vorticity-Solutions.py:  Python code to perform different solution methods for the problem
- Vorticity-PLU-animation-data.py:  Python code using LU decomposition method to solve the problem and generate the file for animation
- animate_data2.csv:  File that contains the image data for generating the animation
- Animation-Generation.ipynb:  Jupyter notebook that imports the image data and generates the animation file
- Gaussian-Elimination-vs-LU-Decomposition:  Document that compares the results for different solution methods
